IFC_roundtrip
-------------
A open, crowdscourced library of IFC/BIM test files--striving for bi-directional/roundtrip functionality between BIM programs.

Hopefully, in the future, this project will evolve to the point that it could be used, in some capacity, to improve the fidelity of BuildingSmart's MVD certifications.

As it is open source, and crowdsourced, please add to the project as you see fit.

I will be working on Revit-->IFC-->Revit translations.  Would be great to work with ArchiCAD, Vectorworks, Microstation, Tekla, etc. IFC experts as well.
