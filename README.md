# IFC_roundtrip

A open, crowdsourced library of IFC/BIM test files--striving for bi-directional/roundtrip functionality between BIM programs.

----------

Hopefully, in the future, this project will evolve to the point that it could be used, in some capacity, to improve the fidelity of BuildingSmart's [MVD Certifications](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/certification).

Initial focus will include Buildingsmart's current MVD releases: 

 - [IFC2x3 Coordination View Version 2.0](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-view-definition/coordination-view-v2.0) (CV_2_0)
 - [IFC2x3 Structural Analysis View](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-view-definition/structural-analysis-view) (SAV)
 - [IFC2x3 Basic FM HandOver](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-view-definition/fm-handover-aquarium) (FMHO)

### Contributing
----------
As it is open source, and crowdsourced, please add to the project as you see fit.  As you can imagine, this is a BIG project.

I will be working on Revit-->IFC-->Revit translations.  Would be great to work with ArchiCAD, Vectorworks, Microstation, Tekla, etc. IFC experts as well.

If you're not familar with Git or Github workflow, I highly recommend using [Github's Windows Client](http://windows.github.com/http://windows.github.com/).  Go [here](http://windows.github.com/help.html), for an overview.  Once you start using this [distributed revision control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control), you will start demanding similar workflows in the AEC industry.
