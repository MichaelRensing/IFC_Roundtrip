# IFC_roundtrip

A open, crowdscourced library of IFC/BIM test files--striving for bi-directional/roundtrip functionality between BIM programs.

----------

Hopefully, in the future, this project will evolve to the point that it could be used, in some capacity, to improve the fidelity of BuildingSmart's MVD certifications.

Initial focus will include Buildingsmart's current MVD releases: 

 - IFC2x3 Coordination View Version 2.0
 - IFC2x3 Structural Analysis View
 - IFC2x3 Basic FM HandOver view (released)

### Contributing
----------
As it is open source, and crowdsourced, please add to the project as you see fit.  As you can imagine, this is a BIG project.

I will be working on Revit-->IFC-->Revit translations.  Would be great to work with ArchiCAD, Vectorworks, Microstation, Tekla, etc. IFC experts as well.

If you're not familar with Git or Github workflow, I highly recommend using [Github's Windows Client](http://windows.github.com/http://windows.github.com/).  Go [here](http://windows.github.com/help.html), for an overview.  Once you start using this [distributed revision control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control), you will start demanding similar workflows in the AEC industry.
